### What is Reticulate?

Reticulate is a cool package that lets R communicate with Python. It converts the R objects types into their equivalent Python types and vice versa, which lets us do some pretty neat things. 

### Reticulate in Action
For instance, say you had a list in R of your favorite prime numbers (doesn't everybody?). And say you also had a list of your favorite prime ministers (that's kind of weird I'll admit).

``` {r warning=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
nums <- c(73, 431, 907, 89, 211)
mins <- c("Margaret Thatcher", "Winston Churchill", "Vladimir Putin", "Indira Gandhi", "David Cameron")
```

And say you wanted to spice things up by combining them into a single list of Primes. You're sure there's an easy way to do this in R (probably by importing some library nobody cares about) but you also know there's an even easier way of doing it in python. And now, with Reticulate, you can simply do: 

``` {python}
primes = r.nums + r.mins
print(primes)
```

Just like that, you have a list of your favorite primes in the same list of your favorite primes, a **prime** example of how useful Reticulate can be!
